The RESPOND (integrated demand REsponse Solution towards energy POsitive NeighbourhooDs) project, aims to deploy and demonstrate an interoperable, cost effective, user centred solution, entailing energy automation, control and monitoring tools, for a seamless integration of cooperative DR programs into the legacy energy management systems. In this endeavour, RESPOND will be leveraged upon an integrated approach for real-time optimal energy dispatching, taking into account both supply and demand side, while exploiting all energy assets available at the site.

The RESPOND solution being developed is foreseen to be flexible and scalable, thus being capable of delivering a cooperative DR both at building and district levels. Furthermore, in order to enable the integration of the DR enabling elements and ensure a high replicability, RESPOND is based on open standards. Likewise, the use of these open standards enables the interoperability with smart home devices and automation systems, as well as the connectivity and extendibility towards smart grid and third-party services such as weather forecasting services and energy price providers. 

Underpinned by the smart energy monitoring infrastructure, RESPOND will leverage data coming from heterogeneous sources to perform various data analytics tasks. On the one hand, sensing, metering and actuating devices deployed in pilot houses will be exploited to develop energy demand forecasting services and ensure dwellers' comfort levels. On the other, the monitoring and forecasting of outdoor conditions will enable the estimation of renewable energy production. Ultimately, the overall objective of all these data analytic tasks is to detect potential energy conservation opportunities, and to adapt in real time to the operational environment.

With the purpose of demonstrating the RESPOND solution, it is being implemented in different types of residential buildings (i.e. apartments, single-family and multi-family houses), situated in different climate zones (i.e. Mediterranean, oceanic and humid continental climate), having different forms of ownership (i.e. rental and home-ownership), population densities and underlying energy systems. Namely, the three RESPOND pilot sites are located in Aarhus (Denmark), the Aran Islands (Ireland) and Madrid (Spain).

Having such a heterogeneous group of end-users hinders the diffusion and impact of DR solutions, and it makes more difficult to ensure sustained user engagement with DR programs. This is why, interaction with end-users is recognized as a key point in the RESPOND project. Consequently, a set of tools and services are planned to deliver measurement driven suggestions to end-users for energy demand reduction and influence their behaviour making them an active indispensable part of DR loop.</span>
